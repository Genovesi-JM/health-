NDVI & SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
=========================

NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index):
- Range: -1 to +1
- >0.6: Healthy, dense vegetation
- 0.4-0.6: Moderate vegetation
- <0.4: Stressed or sparse vegetation
- Values used for crop health assessment

NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index):
- Used for urban mapping and infrastructure detection
- Identifies built-up areas and urban sprawl

NDMI (Normalized Difference Moisture Index):
- Measures water content in vegetation
- Used for drought and water stress assessment
- Critical for irrigation management

Data Processing:
1. Image acquisition via drone
2. Radiometric calibration
3. Atmospheric correction
4. Co-registration and alignment
5. Index calculation

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
==========================

Q: How accurate are drone surveys?
A: We achieve sub-centimeter accuracy with PPK (Post-Processed Kinematic) GPS correction.

Q: What's the typical coverage area per flight?
A: Depends on drone altitude and area size, typically 500-5,000 hectares per mission.

Q: How long does analysis take?
A: Standard processing: 3-5 days. Express: 24 hours.

Q: What happens in bad weather?
A: Operations postponed. Safety is our priority.
